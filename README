See install.sh script to see required steps.

If it did not work at first, probably because you have different version of
RHEL or Thinkpad model, try build library ypurself using recipe below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fprint library was builded using sources
from https://github.com/abbradar/fprint_vfs5011:
1 ./autogen.sh
2 ./configure
3  make
4  make install


These packages was needed to install to fulfill ./autogen.sh requirements:

    Install     libXv-devel-1.0.10-2.el7.x86_64        @rhel-7-workstation-rpms
    Install     gdk-pixbuf2-devel-2.31.6-3.el7.x86_64  @rhel-7-workstation-rpms
    Install     ImageMagick-6.7.8.9-15.el7_2.x86_64    @rhel-7-workstation-rpms
    Install     glib2-devel-2.42.2-5.el7.x86_64        @rhel-7-workstation-rpms
    Install     nss-devel-3.21.0-9.el7_2.x86_64        @rhel-7-workstation-rpms
    Install     libusbx-devel-1.0.15-4.el7.x86_64      @rhel-7-workstation-rpms


Lines from this patch should contain $(GLIB_LIBS) on the end of line:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=78274
If not, add them manually

example:
libfprint/Makefile.in:fprint_list_udev_rules_LDADD = $(builddir)/libfprint.la $(GLIB_LIBS)
libfprint/Makefile.in:  $(AM_V_CCLD)$(fprint_list_udev_rules_LINK) $(fprint_list_udev_rules_OBJECTS) $(fprint_list_udev_rules_LDADD) $(LIBS)
libfprint/Makefile:fprint_list_udev_rules_LDADD = $(builddir)/libfprint.la $(GLIB_LIBS)
libfprint/Makefile:     $(AM_V_CCLD)$(fprint_list_udev_rules_LINK) $(fprint_list_udev_rules_OBJECTS) $(fprint_list_udev_rules_LDADD) $(LIBS)
libfprint/Makefile.am:fprint_list_udev_rules_LDADD = $(builddir)/libfprint.la $(GLIB_LIBS)


At the end, make link to builded library:
echo '/usr/local/lib' > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf


Reload:
ldconfig
